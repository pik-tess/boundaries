\arguments{
\item{files_scenario}{list with variable names and corresponding file paths
(character string) of the scenario LPJmL run. Handled automatically via
\code{\link[=calc_status]{calc_status()}}.}

\item{files_reference}{list with variable names and corresponding file paths
(character string) of the files_reference LPJmL run. Handled automatically
via \code{\link[=calc_status]{calc_status()}}.}

\item{spatial_scale}{character string indicating spatial resolution
options: "global", "regional", "grid";
for "grid" the approach "gerten2020" is applicable based on EFR calculations;
for "global"/"regional" the share (\%) of total global/basin area with
deviations is calculated}

\item{time_span_scenario}{time span to use output from the scenario run,
e.g. \code{1982:2011}.}

\item{time_span_reference}{time span use output from the reference run,
e.g. \code{1901:1930}.}

\item{approach}{approach (character string) to be used , currently available
approach is \code{"gerten2020"} based on
\href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0465-1}{Gerten et al. 2020}
for spatial_scale = "grid" and
"wang_erlandsson2022" as well as "porkka2024" for
spatial_scale = "global" or "regional"}

\item{time_series_avg}{integer. Number of years to be used for the moving
average calculation. If \code{NULL}, all years are averaged for one status
calculation, for \code{1} the whole time span is used to calculate a status time
series.}

\item{config_args}{list of arguments to be passed on from the model
configuration.}

\item{thresholds}{named character string with thresholds to be used to
define the safe, increasing risk and high risk zone, the approach and scale
specific default thresholds are defined in metric_files.yml are are applied
if thresholds are set to NULL.}

\item{cut_min}{double. Exclude boundary calculations for discharge < cut_min
and dismiss EFR transgresssions if < cut_min for "gerten2020" approach,
Default: 0.0864 hm3/day (=1 m3/s)}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{control_variable} with the boundary status of the
bluewater boundary.
}
\description{
Planetary Boundary status calculation of the bluewater boundary (as part of
the freshwater boundary) based on a scenario LPJmL run and a reference LPJmL
run.
